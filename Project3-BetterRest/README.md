## Features

- **AI-Powered Calculations**: Uses Core ML model for accurate sleep predictions
- **Customizable Inputs**: Set wake-up time, desired sleep duration, and coffee intake
- **Smart Recommendations**: Get personalized bedtime suggestions
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clean form-based design with easy controls
- **Precise Timing**: 15-minute increments for sleep duration
- **Coffee Impact**: Considers daily coffee consumption in calculations

## How It Works

1. **Set Wake-Up Time**: Choose when you want to wake up
2. **Choose Sleep Duration**: Select desired hours of sleep (4-12 hours)
3. **Enter Coffee Intake**: Specify daily coffee consumption (1-20 cups)
4. **Calculate Bedtime**: Tap calculate to get AI-powered recommendation
5. **View Results**: See your optimal bedtime based on the ML model

## Machine Learning Features

- **Core ML Integration**: Uses trained SleepCalculator model
- **Multi-Factor Analysis**: Considers wake time, sleep duration, and caffeine
- **Accurate Predictions**: ML model trained on sleep research data
- **Real-time Calculations**: Instant results based on your inputs

## Technical Details

- **Platform**: iOS 17.0+
- **Language**: Swift
- **Framework**: SwiftUI + Core ML
- **Architecture**: ML-powered calculations with state management
- **Key Concepts**: Core ML, MLModelConfiguration, date calculations
