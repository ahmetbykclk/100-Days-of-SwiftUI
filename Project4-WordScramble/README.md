## Features

- **Word Formation**: Create words using letters from a root word
- **Dictionary Validation**: Real-time word checking using UITextChecker
- **Scoring System**: Points based on word length (longer words = more points)
- **Word Validation**: Multiple validation rules for fair gameplay
- **Random Root Words**: New root word for each game session
- **Used Words Tracking**: Prevents duplicate word submissions
- **Accessibility Support**: VoiceOver integration for word lists

## How It Works

1. **Get Root Word**: Start with a random word from the dictionary
2. **Form Words**: Create new words using only the letters from the root word
3. **Submit Words**: Type and submit valid words
4. **Earn Points**: Score points based on word length
5. **Track Progress**: See all your used words with letter counts
6. **Start New Game**: Get a new root word to continue playing

## Validation Rules

- **Minimum Length**: Words must be at least 3 letters long
- **Original Words**: Cannot use the same word twice
- **Letter Availability**: Can only use letters present in the root word
- **Real Words**: Must be valid English words (dictionary checked)
- **Not Root Word**: Cannot use the original root word

- **File Reading**: Loads root words from bundled text file
