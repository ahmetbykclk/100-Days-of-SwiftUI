**Solutions Implemented**:
- Added `.accessibilityLabel()` to all mission patch images
- Added descriptive labels to astronaut photos
- Added semantic labels to navigation buttons
- Added context-aware labels for mission cards and crew members

**Files Modified**:
- `MissionCardView.swift`
- `MissionView.swift`
- `CrewMemberView.swift`
- `AstronautView.swift`

### 2. Missing Accessibility Hints
**Issue**: Users couldn't understand what actions were available.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Added `.accessibilityHint()` to explain navigation actions
- Added hints for layout switching (grid/list view)
- Added hints for horizontal scrolling in crew member view
- Added hints for mission and astronaut detail navigation

**Files Modified**:
- `ContentView.swift`
- `MissionCardView.swift`
- `CrewMemberView.swift`
- `MissionView.swift`

### 3. Missing Accessibility Traits
**Issue**: Screen readers couldn't properly identify interactive elements.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Added `.accessibilityAddTraits(.isButton)` to all navigation links
- Added `.accessibilityAddTraits(.isHeader)` to section headers
- Added `.accessibilityAddTraits(.allowsDirectInteraction)` to toggle buttons

**Files Modified**:
- `ContentView.swift`
- `MissionCardView.swift`
- `CrewMemberView.swift`

### 4. Missing Dynamic Type Support
**Issue**: Text didn't scale properly with system accessibility settings.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Added `.dynamicTypeSize(.large ... .accessibility3)` to all text elements
- Ensured proper text scaling for headlines, captions, and body text
- Maintained readability across all accessibility text sizes

**Files Modified**:
- `ContentView.swift`
- `MissionCardView.swift`
- `MissionView.swift`
- `CrewMemberView.swift`
- `AstronautView.swift`

### 5. Poor Accessibility Grouping
**Issue**: Screen readers couldn't understand the relationship between UI elements.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Added `.accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` for related content
- Added `.accessibilityElement(children: .contain)` for container views
- Hidden decorative images with `.accessibilityHidden(true)`
- Properly grouped mission information and crew details

**Files Modified**:
- `ContentView.swift`
- `MissionCardView.swift`
- `MissionView.swift`
- `CrewMemberView.swift`
- `AstronautView.swift`
- `DividerView.swift`

### 6. Missing Semantic Structure
**Issue**: Content lacked proper semantic organization for screen readers.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Added proper section headers with header traits
- Organized mission information into logical groups
- Added descriptive labels for complex content
- Improved navigation structure

**Files Modified**:
- `MissionView.swift`
- `ContentView.swift`
