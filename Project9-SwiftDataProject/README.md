# Project9-SwiftDataProject - Advanced SwiftData Demo

A SwiftUI application demonstrating advanced SwiftData features including complex queries, filtering, sorting, and data relationships. Features user management with date-based filtering and multiple sorting options.

## Screenshots

<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img src="./Screenshot1.png" width="300" alt="Users List">
    <img src="./Screenshot2.png" width="300" alt="Filtered Users">
    <img src="./Screenshot3.png" width="300" alt="Sort Options">
</div>

## Features

- **User Management**: Add, view, and manage user profiles
- **Date Filtering**: Filter users by join date (upcoming vs. all users)
- **Multiple Sorting**: Sort by name or join date with secondary sorting
- **Sample Data**: Pre-populated sample users for testing
- **Complex Queries**: Advanced SwiftData query patterns
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Real-time filtering based on date criteria
- **Data Relationships**: User profiles with location and date information

## How It Works

1. **View Users**: Browse all users or filter by join date
2. **Add Samples**: Generate sample users for testing
3. **Filter Users**: Toggle between all users and upcoming users
4. **Sort Data**: Choose sorting by name or join date
5. **Manage Data**: View and interact with user profiles
6. **Test Features**: Explore SwiftData's advanced capabilities

## Filtering Options

- **Show Everyone**: Display all users regardless of join date
- **Show Upcoming**: Display only users with future join dates
- **Dynamic Updates**: Real-time filtering as data changes

## Sorting Options

- **Sort by Name**: Primary sort by name, secondary by join date
- **Sort by Join Date**: Primary sort by join date, secondary by name
- **Multiple Descriptors**: Complex sorting with multiple criteria

## Technical Features

- **Advanced Queries**: Complex @Query with filtering and sorting
- **Date Filtering**: Dynamic date-based filtering
- **Multiple SortDescriptors**: Complex sorting with multiple criteria
- **Sample Data Generation**: Programmatic data creation for testing
- **Data Management**: Complete CRUD operations with SwiftData

## Technical Details

- **Platform**: iOS 17.0+
- **Language**: Swift
- **Framework**: SwiftUI + SwiftData
- **Architecture**: Advanced data management patterns
- **Key Concepts**: @Query, SortDescriptor, filtering, complex queries
- **Target**: iPhone (Portrait orientation)
